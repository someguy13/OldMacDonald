================


Start by forking [this repository](https://github.com/APCSLowell/OldMacDonald). As you read through the assignment below, add code to your OldMacDonald program when you get to any instructions in *italics*.  You may find slides 132 - 183 on [OOP.pptx](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz2ZkT6qWPYTN3NOQkh1eGR4Wmc") and the [inheritance](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz2ZkT6qWPYTOTllMzdiMzUtZTk3OC00YmZlLTk1MGMtOTFkNDU2MTQ3OWIx/view?usp=sharing) and [encapsulation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz2ZkT6qWPYTZDQ3NjFmMTctNTRlOS00NjAxLTg3YjQtZTMzMGVjYjA0YjA5) worksheets helpful.

Background: Inheritance and Polymorphism
---------------------------------------- 
In this assignment we will use Old MacDonald's Farm to learn how `implements` and `extends` work, and the meaning of *inheritance* and *polymorphism*.

Defining an interface
---------------------
Old MacDonald had a farm that had several types of animals. Every animal shared certain characteristics: they had a type (such as cow, chick or pig) and each made a sound (moo, cluck or oink). This interface defines those things required to be an animal on the farm.
```    
interface Animal {    
  public String getSound();        
  public String getType(); 
}  
```        
*Complete the Animal interface in the `Animal.java` file. Run the program to make sure it compiles and runs.*

Once we know what it takes to be an Animal, we can define new classes for the cow, chick and pig that implement the Animal interface. Here is a Cow class meeting the minimum requirements to be an Animal.
```     
class Cow implements Animal {     
     private String myType;     
     private String mySound;      
     public Cow(String type, String sound)     {         
         myType = type;         
         mySound = sound;     
     }     
     public Cow()     {         
         myType = "unknown";         
         mySound = "unknown";     
     }      
     public String getSound(){return mySound;}     
     public String getType(){return myType;} 
}
``` 
     
*Add the Cow class to the `Cow.java` file.
Implement classes for the chick and the pig. Run the program to make sure it compiles and runs.
Add the following code to your `setup()` function in the `OldMacDonald.pde` file, and run the program to verify your work so far. Make sure you create some chick and pig instances in `setup()`and check their sounds as well.*
```    
public void setup() {     
    Cow c = new Cow("cow", "moo");   
    System.out.println(c.getType() + " goes " + c.getSound());    
}
```    
*Now add the following Farm class to the `Farm.java` and test all your animals.*
```    
class Farm  {     
   private Animal[] aBunchOfAnimals = new Animal[3];    
   public Farm()     {       
      aBunchOfAnimals[0] = new Cow("cow","moo");           
      aBunchOfAnimals[1] = new Chick("chick","cluck");       
      aBunchOfAnimals[2] = new Pig("pig","oink");    }         
   public void animalSounds()    {       
     for (int nI=0; nI < aBunchOfAnimals.length; nI++)       {          
       System.out.println( aBunchOfAnimals[nI].getType() + " goes " + aBunchOfAnimals[nI].getSound());       
      }    
    } 
} 
```   
*Now, change your code in `setup()` to create an new instance of type `Farm` and call its `animalSounds` function.*  

It turns out that the chick is a little confused. Sometimes it makes one sound, when she is feeling childish, and another when she is feeling more grown up. Her two sounds are "cheep" and "cluck".
*Modify the Chick class code to allow a second constructor allowing two possible sounds and the `getSound()` function to return either sound, with equal probability, if there are two sounds available.
You will also have to modify your Farm class code to construct the Chick with two possible sounds.*

Finally, it also came to pass that the cows get a personal name, like Elsie.

*Create a new class, `NamedCow` in the `NamedCow.java`, that extends the Cow class, adding a 3 argument constructor with arguments for the Cow's name, type and sound. Also, and a new function: `getName`.*
    
The final Farm code to exercise all your modifications is shown here:
```
  class Farm  {     
    private Animal[] aBunchOfAnimals = new Animal[3];    
    public Farm()     {       
       aBunchOfAnimals[0] = new NamedCow("cow","Elsie","moo");          
       aBunchOfAnimals[1] = new Chick("chick","cheep","cluck");
       aBunchOfAnimals[2] = new Pig("pig","oink");    
    }     
    public void animalSounds()    {
      for (int nI=0; nI < aBunchOfAnimals.length; nI++) {             
         System.out.println( aBunchOfAnimals[nI].getType() + " goes " + aBunchOfAnimals[nI].getSound() );       
      }       
         System.out.println( "The cow is known as " + ((NamedCow)aBunchOfAnimals[0]).getName() );    
    } 
}
```    

What Did You Just Do?
---------------------
So you don't miss it, make sure you understand what you just accomplished. Having an array of `Animal` objects and then having the `getSound()` function dynamically decide what sound to make is *polymorphism*. This is also known as late binding because it wasn't known until run-time that `aBunchOfAnimlas[1]`, for example, really had a `Chick` object. You started with an `interface` for an `Animal` and then used the keyword `implements` in making the three types of animals. Then you created a specialized version of the `Cow`, a `NamedCow`, using the keyword `extends`. This illustrates the concept of inheritance. The `NamedCow` had all the attributes and functions of the Cow and then added some: a new field and a new function to access the cow's name.
